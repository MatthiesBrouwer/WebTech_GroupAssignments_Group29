                        HTML is orginally created by Timothy Berners-Lee in late 1990. 
                        When he invented the World Wide Web in 1989, he found the need for a standardized language which could be used for formatting the displaying material retreived over the internet. 
                        That's where HTML short for Hypertext Markup Language came to existence. 
                        The first sign of HTML in public was a discriptive document called "HTML Tags" posted on the internet by the creator himself. This document contained information about the first version of HTML including 18 different elements.
                        At first HTML was seen as an application of SGML (another formatting standard), however when time went by, HTML progressed and became a standalone concept.
