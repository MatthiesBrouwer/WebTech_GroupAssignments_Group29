                <h1>Best practices for beginners</h1>
                <p> Listed below are some of the best practices to keep in mind while working with HTML. 
                </p>
                <ol class ="listofpractices">
                    <li><h4>Be consistent with a proper document structure</h4></li>
                    <p>
                        
                    </p>
                    <li><h4>Declare the correct doctype</h4></li>
                    <p>
                        The doctype declaration should be the first thing in your HTML documents. 
                        The doctype declaration tells the browser about the XHTML standards you will be using and helps it read and render your markup correctly.
                    </p>
                    <img id="Best_practices_one" src="CSS/assets/doctype_BestPractices.png" width="200" height="200" alt="A piece of html code with the doctype specified" >
                    <li><h4>Don't use inline styles</h4></li>
                    <p>
                        Keep your styles separate from your HTML mark-up.
                        It may seem easier to place your styling in line with the code instead of creating an external style sheet in CSS. However, 
                        inline styles are not a good coding practice because it makes it harder to update and maintain your website.
                    </p>
                    <li><h4>Use alt attribute with images and take care of accecibility</h4></li>
                    <p>
                        It is important to have a meaningful alt attribute for validation and accessibility reasons. 
                        The alt attribute provides context to screen readers so it should be descriptive as to what the image contains.
                    </p>
                    <li><h4>Validate frequently</h4></li>
                    <p>
                        Do not valdidate your code first after writing it. Just because your work validates doesn’t automatically mean it’s good code.
                        So while writing HTML, make it a habit to validate frequently to avoid issues that harder to redo later on when the work in completed or lengthier.
                    </p>
                    <li><h4>Use meaningful tags</h4></li>
                    <p>
                        Make your webpage search-engine friendly with the correct usage of tags. 
                        For example the text inside the "<title>" tag will appear in the result page of the search-engine. 
                        Another important tag to make good use of is the description meta tag. 
                        This tag describes the basic purpose of your web page. So you have to put a consise and relevant summary in the tag.
                        This will also show up in the search-engine result page. 
                        And last but not least, use "keywords" that relate to your webpage. These keywords will add even more meaning to the web page. 
                    </p>
                    <li><h4>Close Your Tags</h4></li>
                    <p>
                        Some browsers may still render your pages correctly when you do not close your tags, 
                        however not closing your tags is invalid under standards.
                        So close your tags to avoid validation errors.
