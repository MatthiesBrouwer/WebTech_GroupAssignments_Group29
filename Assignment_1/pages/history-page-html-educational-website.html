                            HTML is orginally created by Timothy Berners-Lee in
                            late 1990.
                            When he invented the World Wide Web in 1989, he
                            found the need for a standardized language which
                            could be used for formatting the displaying material
                            retreived over the internet.
                            That's where HTML short for Hypertext Markup
                            Language came to existence.
                            The first sign of HTML in public was a discriptive
                            document called "HTML Tags" posted on the internet
                            by the creator himself. This document contained
                            information about the first version of HTML
                            including 18 different elements.
                            At first HTML was seen as an application of SGML
                            (another formatting standard), however when time
                            went by, HTML progressed and became a standalone
                            concept.

                            specification
                            is maintained by the most popular browsers such as
                            Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Internet
                            explorer. As
                            seen in the table above, HTML5 was first released in
                            January 2008, with its goals of adding support for
                            the
                            most recent multimedia and other new features.

                            In addition to including multimedia tags, HTML5 also
                            standardized a new way of structuring the HTML
                            documents. Structure elements such as
                            <em><span>&#60;</span>main<span>&#62;</span></em>,
                            <em><span>&#60;</span>section<span>&#62;</span></em>,
                            <em><span>&#60;</span>article<span>&#62;</span></em>,
                            <em><span>&#60;</span>header<span>&#62;</span></em>,
                            <em><span>&#60;</span>footer<span>&#62;</span></em>,
                            <em><span>&#60;</span>aside<span>&#62;</span></em>,

                            were added. These new elements provide a more clear
                            way for external parties, such as search engines, to
                            process the pages in a structured way. This
                            advancement not only made it easier for browsers to
                            process invalid documents, it also made advancement
                            in the usability and accessibility of browsers more
                            prominent.

                            Now, why is HTML5 called the living standard? To
                            answer this question, you need a little background.
                            During the development of HTML5 there was a great
                            conflict between the two main parties working on
                            HTML (W3C and WHATWG). The conflict being: W3C
                            wanting to create a finished version of HTML5 while
                            WHATWG wanting to keep working and improving the
                            version. Finally both groups came to an agreement to
                            work together on a single version of HTML5 in 2019.
                            Now, the reason HTML5 has the nickname “living
                            standard” is because rather than creating one
                            specific version the specification is updated every
                            once in a while, adding new features which evolves
                            the platform. So if you ask us, the WHATWG did a
                            good job at convincing W3C of implementing their
                            structural idea.
