        <p class="history-section__text main-content__text--base col-s__2 col-e__7">
            HTML is orginally created by Timothy Berners-Lee in
                    late 1990.
                    When he invented the World Wide Web in 1989, he
                    found the need for a standardized language which
                    could be used for formatting the displaying material
                    retreived over the internet.
                    That's where HTML short for Hypertext Markup
                    Language came to existence.
                    The first sign of HTML in public was a discriptive
                    document called "HTML Tags" posted on the internet
                    by the creator himself. This document contained
                    information about the first version of HTML
                    including 18 different elements.
                    At first HTML was seen as an application of SGML
                    (another formatting standard), however when time
                    went by, HTML progressed and became a standalone
                    concept.

            HTML5 is the fifth and last major HTML version which
                    got
                    recommended by W3C. The current specification of
                    HTML 5
                    is known as the HTML Living Standard. This
                    specification
                    is maintained by the most popular browsers such as
                    Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Internet
                    explorer. As
                    seen in the table above, HTML5 was first released in
                    January 2008, with its goals of adding support for
                    the
                    most recent multimedia and other new features.
                    Example of these new elements include
                    <em><span>&#60;</span>video<span>&#62;</span></em>,
                    <em><span>&#60;</span>audio<span>&#62;</span></em>
                    and

        <p class="history-section__text main-content__text--base col-s__2 col-e__9 row-s__3 row-e__4">
            In addition to including multimedia tags, HTML5 also
                    standardized a new way of structuring the HTML
                    documents. Structure elements such as
                    <em><span>&#60;</span>main<span>&#62;</span></em>,
                    <em><span>&#60;</span>section<span>&#62;</span></em>,
                    <em><span>&#60;</span>article<span>&#62;</span></em>,
                    <em><span>&#60;</span>header<span>&#62;</span></em>,
                    <em><span>&#60;</span>footer<span>&#62;</span></em>,
                    <em><span>&#60;</span>aside<span>&#62;</span></em>,
                    <em><span>&#60;</span>nav<span>&#62;</span></em> and
                    <em><span>&#60;</span>figure<span>&#62;</span></em>
                    were added. These new elements provide a more clear
                    way for external parties, such as search engines, to
                    process the pages in a structured way. This
                    advancement not only made it easier for browsers to
                    process invalid documents, it also made advancement
                    in the usability and accessibility of browsers more
                    prominent.

        <p class="history-section__text main-content__text--base col-s__2 col-e__9 row-s__5 row-e__6">
            Now, why is HTML5 called the living standard? To
                    answer this question, you need a little background.
                    During the development of HTML5 there was a great
                    conflict between the two main parties working on
                    HTML (W3C and WHATWG). The conflict being: W3C
                    wanting to create a finished version of HTML5 while
                    WHATWG wanting to keep working and improving the
                    version. Finally both groups came to an agreement to
                    work together on a single version of HTML5 in 2019.
                    Now, the reason HTML5 has the nickname “living
                    standard” is because rather than creating one
                    specific version the specification is updated every
                    once in a while, adding new features which evolves
                    the platform. So if you ask us, the WHATWG did a
                    good job at convincing W3C of implementing their
                    structural idea.

            Fun fact: Given the circumstances it’s not likely
                    there will ever be a HTML6.
